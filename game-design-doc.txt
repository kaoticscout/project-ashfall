Project Codename: Ashfall
1. High Concept

Ashfall is a multiplayer survival **action RPG** where you play a **hero character**: you level up, gear up, and take on escalating enemies and bosses with **WoW-inspired combat** (quick movement, hotbar abilities, cooldown windows, readable telegraphs, satisfying AoE). Exploration is fast and fluid thanks to **mounted traversal** and quick dismount-to-fight pacing.

Optional competitive incentives (events/objectives/ladders) can refresh on a cadence, but the core game should not feel like an RTS “war sim” or colony economy loop.

The game blends:

Survival crafting (Valheim / Rust)

Hero action combat (WoW)

Seasonal competitive resets

Every week is a war story.
Every season is a competitive arc.

2. Core Fantasy

Become a hero. Master your build. Explore the world. Defeat bosses. Earn your legacy.

Players are:

physically embodied heroes

competitive faction rivals

survivors of a dying world

3. Core Pillars
3.1 Embodied Survival

WASD, third-person, action combat. The player is physically vulnerable.

3.2 WoW-Inspired Combat + Movement

Quick, responsive traversal and hotbar ability combat (cooldowns, AoE, defensives, interrupts, curated CC).

3.3 Hero Identity / Buildcraft

Players ascend into heroes with abilities and skill trees.

3.4 Mounted Exploration

The world is meant to be traveled; mounts make exploration fast and satisfying.

3.5 Homestead Building (Secondary)

Valheim-like base building supports the adventure loop (crafting/comfort/storage/travel) without becoming the main power curve.

3.6 Seasonal Competitive Structure

Weekly worlds feed into long-term seasonal ranks.

3.7 Escalating Threats

The world becomes more hostile every day.

4. Game Structure
World Shards

40–80 players per shard

Solo or 2–6 player factions

7-day persistent simulation

Offline bases remain active

Vulnerable but defendable

At Day 7:
World collapses → scoring → reset

5. Weekly Cycle Arc
Day 1–2: Establishment

Land rush

Starter bases

Low PvP

Day 3–4: Expansion

NPC camp conflict

Faction tension rises

Strategic resource fights

Day 5–6: Collapse Phase

Base sieges

elite monsters

territory wars

Day 7: Final Stand

Apocalypse event

forced convergence

last battles determine ranking

World resets after collapse.

6. Seasonal Structure

A season contains:

6–10 weekly worlds

cumulative ranking system

cosmetic + prestige rewards

leaderboard visibility

Seasonal goals:

encourage long-term play

reward consistency

create competitive identity

At season end:

ranks locked

rewards distributed

new season meta begins

7. Seasonal Ranking System

Players earn points weekly based on:

Territory control

NPC camp clears

Hero combat performance

Base survival

Resource dominance

PvP victories

Final collapse placement

Rank tiers example:

Bronze

Iron

Silver

Gold

Mythic

Legend

Ranks represent strategic mastery, not just kill count.

8. Player Lifecycle
Phase 1: Adventurer

basic kit online immediately

clear early POIs

first gear upgrades

Phase 2: Specialization

talents/runes/augments unlock build identity

mobility + AoE + defensives come online

target elite objectives (bosses, contested events)

Phase 3: Endgame Mastery

optimized builds and gear chasing

high-skill combat vs elite threats

optional ladders/events/PvP hotspots tied to objectives

9. Hero System

Heroes gain:

XP from combat

camp clears

defense events

faction wars

Leveling grants:

ability upgrades

passives

traits

Archetype examples:

Warlord (army buffs)

Architect (base power)

Hunter (PvP assassin)

Warden (defense)

Mystic (control/support)

Hero progression resets weekly.
Account unlocks persist seasonally.

10. Death System

Hero death results in:

inventory drop

potential gear loss

respawn timer

temporary injury debuff

Hero identity persists.
Inventory risk remains.

Death is punishing, not deleting.

11. Movement & Combat
Controls

WASD movement

third-person camera

ability hotbar

dodge/mobility

Combat Goals

weighty

responsive

readable

skill expressive

Inspired by WoW + survival action combat.

12. Base Building System

Valheim/Rust-style construction:

snap placement

blueprint preview

crafting stations + storage

comfort/home buffs

optional travel convenience

Base tiers:

Tier 1 — Outpost
Tier 2 — Settlement
Tier 3 — Stronghold

13. AI Unit System
Optional helpers/automation (if included) must be bounded and must not become an RTS micro layer.

14. Resource Economy
Common

wood, stone, scrap, fiber

Strategic

relics, cores, rare metals

Strategic resources drive PvP conflict.

15. NPC Camp System

PvE escalation gates:

bandit camps

fortified strongholds

bosses

world event zones

Serve as PvP hotspots.

16. Territory System

Soft influence model:

Optional PvP objectives model:

contested hotspots tied to elite objectives/events

avoid offline-base raiding as a primary loop

17. Progression Layers
Persistent Hero Progression

hero levels
gear
build unlocks

Seasonal Persistence

cosmetics
blueprints
traits
prestige ranks

18. Emotional Design Goals

The game should generate stories:

last stand defenses

risky loot runs

hero duels

betrayal alliances

collapse finales

Memory > loot.

19. MVP Scope

Prototype includes:

1 biome

20–30 player shard

Tier 1 base building (camp + crafting + comfort)

hero prototype (WoW-like movement feel + splashy ability kit)

mount traversal prototype

NPC camps tier 1–2

1 boss encounter

optional event cadence prototype

Goal: validate tension loop.

20. Key Risks

snowball factions

offline raiding frustration

system overload

complexity intimidation

server cost

burnout from cadence

Requires careful pacing + onboarding.
